# ChessBoard
From what I have seen, many chessboard implementations are extremely complicated and hard to grasp, especially for a beginner. So, I challenged myself to create the simplest implementation of a chessboard I thought possible, from scratch, to see what it'd look like. Ultimately, I created a javascript based application, handling all the squares as table elements and storing temporary piece information to create movement - Now, because this is, after all, a simple chess board applicatipn, I opted not to go for animation work, instead opting for pieces disappearing and appearing when necessary.
